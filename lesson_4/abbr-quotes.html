	<blockquote cite="file:///Users/artismarti/code/udemy/html_css_scratch/lesson_4/abbr-quotes.html">If the cache manifest has expired (according to its HTTP headers), then your browser will ask the server whether there is a new version, and if so, the browser will download it. To do this, your browser issues an HTTP request that includes that last-modified date of the cache manifest, which your web server included in the HTTP response headers the last time your browser downloaded the manifest file. If the web server determines that the manifest file hasnâ€™t changed since that date, it will simply return a 304 (Not Modified) status. Again, none of this is specific to offline web applications. This happens for essentially every kind of resource on the web.</blockquote>
